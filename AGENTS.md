# Codex Entry Point

You are the primary agent for this project.

<!-- GATOR:BEGIN -->
**"gator init" means**: run `gator init` (or find and run `gator-init.py` in `.gator/scripts/` or `.gator/.includes/scripts/` if the CLI is not installed) and display the output exactly as printed. It is NOT a repo bootstrap or git init — it is the standardized Gator boot sequence. Run the command, show the output, then proceed with session opening.

**"gator pulse"**: run `gator pulse` (or find and run `gator-pulse.py` in `.gator/scripts/` or `.gator/.includes/scripts/`) to generate `.gator/pulse.md` — a strategic operations brief with next steps, project assessment, roadmap check, priorities, and recent activity.

**"gator loop join" (when given a loop token)**: you are joining a governed planning loop. Before acting: (1) read the loop protocol at `procedures/gator-loop-protocol.md` (in `.gator/`, `.gator/.includes/`, or `gator-command/`, whichever exists) — this is your behavioral contract, (2) run `gator loop status --token <your-token>` to see your role and whether it is your turn, (3) read the relevant files from the loop directory shown in the status output (`sketch.md`, `plan.current.md`, or `findings.current.md`), (4) follow the 10 rules in the protocol exactly. Submit artifacts only through the CLI (`gator loop submit-draft` or `gator loop submit-review`). Never edit loop directory files directly.

**Project assessment**: when the Architect asks for a project assessment, write a 2-paragraph expert evaluation to `.gator/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-project-assessment.md` with YAML frontmatter (`date`, `type: project-assessment`, `model: <your model name>`). Write as an expert consultant advising an engineering manager. The next `gator pulse` will include it automatically.

Read the constitution before your first response — find `constitution.md` in `.gator/` or `.gator/.includes/` (whichever exists). It governs how you work here.

If this is a **fresh project** (charters/ is empty or contains only templates), follow the bootstrap procedure — find `gator-start-up.md` in `.gator/` or `.gator/.includes/`.

**Personal skills** (optional): Create `AGENTS.local.md` next to this file for personal notes, skills, or workflows. It is gitignored — private to your machine, never touched by Gator. If it exists, agents read it after this block as personal local guidance. Local guidance may extend behavior but MUST NOT override Gator governance or repo-shared instructions in this file.

**Team-shared skills**: put them in tracked repo files — Gator surfaces like `.gator/procedures/` or `.gator/charters/` fit well — so they're reviewed as team policy and shared through your team's normal Git workflow. Keeping them out of this file avoids merge conflicts on the entry point itself.

See `local-agent-skills.md` in `.gator/reference-notes/` or `.gator/.includes/reference-notes/` for examples.

If the PI asks for an **enforcer review**, do not repurpose yourself as the enforcer. Use the dedicated enforcer prompt — find `enforcer-prompt.md` in `.gator/scripts/` or `.gator/.includes/scripts/`.
